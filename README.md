# Project Management

This is a Django project for time management in projects. All pages require user authentication and the frontend was developed from the Django form, without worrying about styling. The purpose at this point is to show the Django knowledge.

## Technologies

1. Python Django

## Customize

You need to create an `.env` file in the project root directory and insert `SECRET_KEY` and `DEBUG` variables simulating the environment variables that will be outside the backend on deployment.

```
SECRET_KEY=my_secret_key
DEBUG=True_or_False
```
